Release 1.0, codegen version 0.2.7 ..
- I changed names of identifiers to names more fitting to my eye, such as lval() function to eval() function, and the like.
- I changed code generation to reflect dereferencing auto variables off the stack using BP, (SS:BP).  This is the first step to recodifying to a segment or section model.  Variables of external storage class are dereferenced thru DS:offset.  This works only because SS == DS, the rest of the step cannot be completed until the parser is improved to carry forward more information about a pointer pointing to 'object of storage class; auto or external'.  Instead of using a small .com memory model, the next major goal is employ separate stack, data, and code segmented model.  A further look into this seems to indicate to me that not enough information about the storage class of an indentifier is held in the parser state array used by eval().
- I improved the code generation in a number of small ways that suggested themselves.
- The syntax is still K&R, the code generated is still 80186ish.
