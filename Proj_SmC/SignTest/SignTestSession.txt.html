<I><P>
Small-C takes a blank line response to exit, so press [Enter] or [Return] now in response its query for another source file, and compiling will begin.  The VERBOSE is set to on in the Library as a debugging aid.  You'll notice above that one file was created, the output file, and two more files were opened for reading, the C source file, and the Library File.  Cain designed the input this way so that incremental building could be done from the command line, so that the compiler could be fed a series of files.  #include filename, works as well.
