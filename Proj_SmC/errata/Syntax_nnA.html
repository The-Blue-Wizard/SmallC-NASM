Notes: statements outside of a block '{..}', are expected
to be declarations, or function definitions, etc.  These
are being looked at by the parse() function.

/* At this level, only static declarations, */
/*	defines, includes, and function */
/*	definitions are legal...	*/
parse()
... 

Next, let's reform our statement by putting it inside the
main() {..} block... (although any named function block
will do.)

Notes: Here, x is undefined yet, as it is not seen as an
lvalue. Historically, lvalue and rvalue take their cue
from their position in an assignment statement:
lvalue := rvalue; .such that. (for C Syntax),
     a = b; .where. the value held in the location ident-
ified by variable 'b' is copied to the location identified
by variable 'a'.
.thus. a variable can be said to possess the three attri-
butes of; a lexeme 'b', a location, and a value.  In
contrast, a constant has only two attributes; a lexeme '3'
and a value, but no location.  .thus. an assignment to a
constant is an error state.  Because of this, I think of
lvalue in terms of being the 'location value' of a variable,
and a rvalue in terms of being the 'referenced value' held
in a variable's lvalue.

Next, let's define 'x' statically, outside a block...

/** synt003.c - syntax test 00A **/

----------------------------------------------------------
Notes: Notice that, even though the functions haven't 
been defined as returning anything, (as of now, they
haven't a function definition), it is taken as a 
default that a value is returned in the Primary Register,
AX.  Hence, the assembler output structure makes sense,
but the program logic is still unformed.  Note that there
are no syntax errors found.
Small-C sees a named function as a call to that function.
At this point, f(), and g(), are left to NASM to resolve, 
they could be in another file to be included.

Next, let's give the named functions their definition...

----------------------------------------------------------
Notes:  Here we have more confidence in the program, that
the logic is well formed in this unit.  So we see, as far
as Small-C is concerned, f() and g() could just as well
be external to this file without a problem.

Next, let's move 'x' from being static storage class to
being auto storage class (local to main)...

----------------------------------------------------------
Notes:  Here we see how auto variables are handled by 
Small-C, they are stack variables local to the current
activation record...

It may be somewhat confusing how Small-C handles these.
The methods stem from life on an 8080 cpu which hasn't any
segment registers and code, data, and stack share a common
address space.  Where the x86 cpu's have SP and BP, the
8080 had only SP, so activation frames took a different
form.  The Small-c method is upward compatible, but
inelegant, so this is an area to be addressed now that
Small-C compiles itself into NASM assembler.

First, as an auto is parsed, space on the stack is created
for it by PUSH Primary, irregardless of the value held in
the Primary, its purpose is to decrement the SP by sizeof
INT.

Secondly, when the auto is parsed, a local symbol table
entry is created for it by the compiler and it's relative
location in relation to the SP is recorded, this value is
an ordinal, an index by sizeof type, indicating its relative
position in the list of auto's parsed for this frame.  This
value and SP form the offset address of the autos' location,
and a pointer to the auto is formed and pushed secondly onto
the stack.  Thus for the one auto 'x' above;

PUSH AX => creates space for 'x' as declared..
.
MOV  AX,0
ADD  AX,SP => forms a pointer to 'x' (local, on the stack).
PUSH AX    => Secondly, saves pointer to 'x' to use in
further reference to 'x' in..
POP  BX
MOV  [BX],AX .. as in assigning a result to 'x'.

Because of the auto nature of 'x', it is lost when the
function returns.

The value held in 'x' can be returned in the Primary Reg.
through the C statement; return x;. -But is already in AX
in our simple function as a side effect of being the only
auto object operated on.
