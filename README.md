This repository is a (near?) mirror of the old SmallC-NASM stuff that used to be at http://www.project-fbin.hostoi.com (Note: the link is dead). It might not be the latest copy, but it is all I have. So it is back on Internet, sort of!

The source code for Small C compiler here is in public domain. I assume everything else is in public domain as well.
