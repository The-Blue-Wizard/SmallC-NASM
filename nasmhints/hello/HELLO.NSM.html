;; Notes: hello.com runs as HELLO.COM under the various
;; Windows, XP OSes.  CMD.EXE is the DPMI v0.9 host
;; which loads and runs these, usually automatically
;; by just clicking on the file, such as HELLO.COM,
;; however you can adjust aspects of this process by
;; creating a 'shortcut' to such an executable by
;; 'right clicking' on it.  Doing that brings up a 
;; menu which has the selection to 'Create Shortcut'.
;; Selecting that creates a control file: 'Shortcut to
;; HELLO.COM'.  Again, but this time by 'right clicking'
;; the short cut itself, brings up another menu with a
;; 'Properties' selection.  Selecting 'Properties' will
;; give a dialog box allowing access to the default
;; aspects of how the DPMI host will treat the
;; executable.  There are numerous aspects, but of note
;; to us is the 'Program' tab.  Selecting that gives
;; access to 2 noteworthy things, A) there is a check-
;; box for 'Close on Exit', normally we want that
;; unchecked so we can see output from HELLO.COM, or
;; any other executable before the final exit.  Above,
;; the code at .DONE stalls until a keypress, for that
;; reason, because the default property is to 'Close
;; on Exit'.  B) There is a dialog box titled 'Cmd
;; line:' which has the 'path' to our target HELLO.COM.
;; There is a convenient option which can be indicated
;; by appending a space and the question mark
;; character: '?'.  This option is not used for 
;; HELLO.COM, which doesn't accept user runtime
;; options.  But it is quite useful for running the
;; NASM compiler.  The ? opens up a runtime 
;; dialog box so the user can specify command line 
;; parameters for the executable, such as NASM, 
;; directly when the executable begins.  Don't forget
;; to save any changes made by clicking the 'Apply'
;; button.  For running NASM then to assemble
;; HELLO.NSM, we can cut and paste the above-
;; -f bin -l hello.lst -o hello.com hello.nsm
;; into the command line dialog popup when we double
;; click the 'Shortcut to NASM.EXE'.
;; Another word about shortcuts.  They are control
;; files.  They can be copied to other locations, but
;; this is a bad practice because the Paths will end
;; up pointing to unexpected or non-existing
;; locations.
;; You may get the error shown in the screenshot, i.e.
;; "Bad command or file name" but this doesn't affect
;; the nasm assembly, as the directory listing shows
;; the resulting files.  On my system this error was 
;; cured by commenting out fcbs=20 -> REM fcbs=20 in
;; AUTOEXEC.NT, the CONFIG.NT is set to: fcbs=8,
;; files=40 in the C:\WINDOWS\system32 directory.
